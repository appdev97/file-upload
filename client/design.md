# Design specifications

## Current Design

### UI/UX

- Search / Show: added custom hook called useDebounce to avoid unnecessary api calls
- Upload
- Delete

### Codebase

- This app was built using `React` and `TypeScript`. I leveraged the power of `React-Query` to efficiently fetch and cache data. To make our app visually appealing, I used `MUI` for the styling.

## Future Improvements

- I can add skeleton loading
- I can implement infinite scroll / pagination.
- I can implement the virtualization functionality to increase IT agility, flexibility and scalability.
- I can write automatic tests to ensure the code quality, eliminates human errors, save time & money.
- I can implement confirm dialog before deleting the image
- I can add animations.
- I can make it more mobile friendly.
- I can setup prettier/husky/git commands/etc.
